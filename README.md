Adventures in Tinkering With LezWatch.TV's API and Maybe Some Data Analysis

#### What is "Lezwatchtv"?

It's great and I'll find a better description to attach here. In the meantime go look at it: https://lezwatchtv.com

#### What is this project?
I'm queer, I want to learn how to use API's, and I love data science.

#### To do:
* Data analysis pipeline for preparing data in Jupyter Notebook: read JSON, Pandas, etc.
* Examine data and come up with preliminary questions based off of initial examination.

#### Questions to ask the data:
* Is there a correlation of tropes and country, year aired, etc.?
